# Mercure Platform.sh Template

Mercure is an open protocol for real-time communications designed to be fast, reliable and battery-efficient. It is a modern and convenient replacement for both the Websocket API and the higher-level libraries and services relying on it.

Mercure is especially useful to add streaming capabilities to REST and GraphQL APIs. Because it is a thin layer on top of HTTP and SSE, Mercure is natively supported by modern web browsers, mobile applications and IoT devices.

See https://mercure.rocks.

Make sure you change in `mercure/.environment`

```
MERCURE_PUBLISHER_JWT_KEY='!ChangeMe!'
MERCURE_SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY='!ChangeMe!'
```

You probably also want to disable the demo/ui in:
`mercure/Caddyfile.upsun` and possibly allowing anonymous users.
